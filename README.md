To validate whether reduced transmissions translate to real power savings and extended sensor life, we implemented a BLE network consisting of a single sensor and a receiver and measured its power consumption under varied upload and sampling frequencies with two different connectivity setups. Power measurements were obtained using Nordic’s Power Profiler Kit II (PPK2), which provides high-resolution current measurements sampled at 100,000 samples per second to capture the short, rapid spikes during BLE transmissions.
